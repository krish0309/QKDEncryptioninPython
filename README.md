# QKDEncryptioninPython
This simulates the Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) process using the BB84 protocol to generate a shared key between Alice and Bob. The shared key is then used for Fernet encryption and decryption, ensuring secure communication.  Libraries and Technologies Used:  Python, Cirq, Fernet encryption library, hashes, and PBKDF2HMAC
